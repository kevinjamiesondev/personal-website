          Iâ€™m Kevin Jamieson, a front-end web developer and designer based in Northwest Arkansas. 
          I create custom, user-friendly websites that are clean, responsive, and built to perform. 
          With experience in WordPress and modern front-end development, I help businesses bring 
          their ideas online with solutions that are both visually engaging and easy to manage. 
          My goal is to make websites that not only look great, but also support your growth and 
          connect with your audience.
