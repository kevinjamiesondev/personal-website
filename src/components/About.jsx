          I’m Kevin Jamieson, a front-end web developer and designer based in
          Northwest Arkansas. I create custom, user-friendly websites that are
          clean, responsive, and built to perform. With experience in WordPress
          and modern front-end development, I help businesses bring their ideas
          online with solutions that are both visually engaging and easy to
          manage. My goal is to make websites that not only look great, but also
          support your growth and connect with your audience.
